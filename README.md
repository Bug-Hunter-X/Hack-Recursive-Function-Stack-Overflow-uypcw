This repository contains a Hack program that demonstrates a common coding error: a stack overflow error caused by unbounded recursion.  The `foo` function calculates the factorial, but the recursive call never terminates properly for inputs greater than 0.  The solution demonstrates how to correct this error by adding a proper base case to avoid indefinite recursion and ensure the function terminates gracefully.
